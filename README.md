# Wrist & Body Sync

Wrist & Body Sync is designed to make your Apple Watch’s nightly wrist temperature data actually useful—by letting you view, chart, and synchronize those “Wrist Temp” readings into your standard Body Temperature HealthKit record. This makes your Apple Watch’s unique data available to any health app or platform that looks for Body Temp, not just the hidden wrist log.

Purpose and Usage
Most iOS apps can display Body Temperature data from Apple Health, but only a handful of devices—specifically Apple Watches with nightly wrist temperature sensors—actually provide new body temp data. Even then, these watches store temperature in a “Wrist Temps” field that’s hidden from most apps and health platforms.

Wrist & Body Sync bridges this gap:

View, chart, and track your nightly Apple Watch wrist temperature readings.

Manually or automatically sync wrist temperature data into your main Body Temperature HealthKit record.

Unlock full compatibility: Once synced, your temperature data is accessible to any app, system, or export that expects a “Body Temp” record—not just a hidden log.

100% on-device: No data ever leaves your phone. No cloud storage, no analytics, no ads.

Typical uses:

Visualize temperature trends overnight or across weeks/months.

Use your Apple Watch’s temperature sensor for full health record integration.

Provide richer data to fertility, sleep, or health-tracking apps—even if your device never officially recorded body temp before.
